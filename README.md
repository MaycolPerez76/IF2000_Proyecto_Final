# IF2000_Proyecto_Final
This is the last project that we make in group for the course of program I
The program consists of a collaborative project created by Dylan Montero, Maycol Perez, and Eitel Jimenez. It is based on a flight reservation system where the information entered will be validated using various methods.

This, in turn, is divided into packages called logic, interface, domain, and IF2000, which will contain the main function. The logic package contains its respective methods. The domain package handles constructors, attributes, setters, and getters. The interface package manages the windows and calls the methods, constructors, setters, and getters that will be passed to the main function. Finally, the IF2000_Proyecto_Final package contains the main function and displays the windows and all the information contained within the code.

To run the program, you must use the Java language and implement it in NetBeans. It must be executed through the main class, which contains all the stored code. From there, you fill in the required data and verify that the entered information matches the requirements.
